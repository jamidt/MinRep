# MinRep

Takes one cpp file and extracts all depending local header files.

Be advised, this is a horrible hack and far from being the "pythionic"
way. Using this might cause hairloss (I can attest this) and other
unforseen side effects.

TODO and problems:
* Works only for header files.
* Linux master race only.
